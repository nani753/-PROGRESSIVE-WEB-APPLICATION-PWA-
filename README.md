- **Push Notifications**: Browser-based notifications for cart updates and order confirmations
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design that works seamlessly across all devices
- **Fast Loading**: Optimized performance with caching strategies and lazy loading

### E-commerce Features
- **Product Catalog**: Browse products with search and category filtering
- **Product Details**: Detailed product pages with image galleries and specifications
- **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart that works offline with quantity management
- **Checkout Process**: Complete checkout flow with form validation
- **Real-time Updates**: Live cart updates and inventory management

## üõ† Technologies Used

### Frontend Framework & Language
- **React 18.3.1**: Modern React with hooks and functional components for building the user interface
- **TypeScript 5.5.3**: Type-safe JavaScript for better development experience and code reliability
- **Vite 5.4.2**: Next-generation frontend build tool for fast development and optimized production builds

### Styling & UI
- **Tailwind CSS 3.4.1**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Lucide React 0.344.0**: Beautiful, customizable SVG icons for modern web applications
- **PostCSS 8.4.35**: CSS post-processor for advanced styling capabilities
- **Autoprefixer 10.4.18**: Automatic vendor prefixing for cross-browser compatibility

### PWA Technologies
- **Service Workers**: Background scripts for caching, offline functionality, and push notifications
- **Web App Manifest**: JSON file defining app metadata for installation and app-like behavior
- **IndexedDB**: Client-side database for storing products, cart items, and user data offline
- **Push API**: Browser API for receiving push notifications from the server
- **Notification API**: Browser API for displaying native notifications to users

### Development Tools
- **ESLint 9.9.1**: JavaScript/TypeScript linter for code quality and consistency
- **TypeScript ESLint**: ESLint configuration specifically for TypeScript projects
- **React Hooks ESLint Plugin**: Linting rules for React hooks best practices
- **React Refresh**: Hot module replacement for React components during development

## üì± PWA Architecture

### Service Worker Implementation
The application uses a comprehensive Service Worker strategy that includes:
- **Cache-First Strategy**: Static assets (HTML, CSS, JS) are served from cache for instant loading
- **Network-First Strategy**: Dynamic content like product data attempts network first, falls back to cache
- **Background Sync**: Queues failed requests for retry when connectivity is restored
- **Push Event Handling**: Manages incoming push notifications and displays them to users

### Offline Data Management
- **IndexedDB Integration**: Robust client-side database for storing:
  - Product catalog with images and metadata
  - Shopping cart items with persistence across sessions
  - User preferences and application state
- **Data Synchronization**: Automatic sync between online and offline data when connectivity is restored
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles data conflicts when multiple devices modify the same data

### Responsive Design System
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Designed primarily for mobile devices, enhanced for larger screens
- **Breakpoint System**: Tailored layouts for mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+)
- **Touch-Friendly Interface**: Optimized touch targets and gestures for mobile interaction
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works on all devices, enhanced features on capable devices

## üé® Design Philosophy

### User Experience (UX)
- **Apple-Level Design Aesthetics**: Meticulous attention to detail with clean, sophisticated visual presentation
- **Micro-Interactions**: Thoughtful animations and transitions that provide visual feedback
- **Loading States**: Skeleton screens and loading indicators for better perceived performance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states with helpful messaging and recovery options

### Visual Design
- **Color System**: Comprehensive color palette with primary, secondary, accent, and semantic colors
- **Typography**: Consistent font hierarchy with optimal line spacing (150% for body, 120% for headings)
- **Spacing System**: 8px grid system for consistent spacing and alignment
- **Component Library**: Reusable UI components following atomic design principles

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16.0 or higher
- npm or yarn package manager
- Modern web browser with PWA support

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd shoppwa

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

### Development Workflow
1. **Development**: Run `npm run dev` for hot-reload development server
2. **Linting**: Run `npm run lint` to check code quality
3. **Building**: Run `npm run build` to create optimized production build
4. **Testing**: Test PWA features using browser developer tools

## üîß Configuration

### PWA Manifest
The `manifest.json` file configures:
- App name, description, and branding
- Icon sets for different device resolutions
- Display mode and orientation preferences
- Theme colors and background colors
